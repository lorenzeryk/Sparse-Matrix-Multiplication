# Sparse Matrix Multiplication
Project for CSCI580 to implement sparse matrix multiplication utilizing OpenMP for multithreading. The code will perform the matrix multiplication and then verify the results utilizing ALGLIB.

## Input File
The input file format is the matrix market exchange format. Once the file is read random values will be generated (between 0.1 and 4.9) for the matrix and vector.

## Output
The code will output the execution time that the matrix multiplication took and alert the user if the resultant matrix was incorrect.
